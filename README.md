# Prediction-of-Best-Position-of-Football-Players-using-ML

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the optimal positions for football players using machine learning techniques applied to publicly available FIFA 22 data. The goal is to provide a data-driven approach to assist in player positioning decisions, complementing traditional coaching expertise.

## Technologies Used
Programming Languages: R, Python
Tools: RStudio, Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The project utilizes FIFA 22 player data from SoFIFA.com, which includes comprehensive technical, physical, and mental attributes for players. Outfield player data was primarily used for the analysis, excluding goalkeepers.

## Methodology
The methodology involved:
-Dataset Cleaning and Formatting: Handled duplicates, missing values, data type conversions, and removed irrelevant variables.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset using R.
-Machine Learning Models: Implemented and evaluated various models for position prediction.

## Machine Learning Models and Results
The following machine learning models were applied, with their respective accuracies:
-Decision Tree: 0.8288
-Random Forest: 0.8878
-Logistic Regression: 0.7788
-K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN): 0.7423
The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy in predicting player positions.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrated the application of machine learning to predict optimal football player positions, offering a valuable data-driven tool for strategic player management.
